 Developed an Amazon clone web application using HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code. The project includes a responsive design with features such as product listings, a search
 bar, and a shopping cart. I implemented interactivity with JavaScript to handle user actions, such as adding items to the cart. This project enhanced my front-end development 
 skills.
